"""Per-tenant key resolver — Phase F PR-F3.

# Threat model

TOIN (Tool Output Intelligence Network) learns compression patterns from
every observed request. Pre-F3 those patterns aggregated into one global
pool keyed by ``(auth_mode, model_family, sig_hash)``. That works for an
OSS single-tenant deploy, but in a multi-tenant SaaS / shared-proxy
deploy it's a cross-tenant pattern leak: tenant A's tool-call patterns
train recommendations that the proxy then applies to tenant B's
requests. Two distinct customers carrying differently-shaped tool
outputs can degrade each other's compression quality, and (worse) a
tenant could probe TOIN dumps and learn the structural fingerprint of
another tenant's tool surface.

F3 partitions: every TOIN store key gets a ``tenant_key`` prefix
derived from the inbound request. Two tenants therefore train two
isolated pools — the dataclass on disk is unchanged, only the key
namespace grows by one component.

# Resolution rules

The resolver picks the most-specific signal available, in this order:

1. **Header** — when ``HEADROOM_TENANT_KEY_HEADER`` (default
   ``X-Headroom-Tenant-ID``) is present and survives sanitization
   (alphanumeric / ``-`` / ``_``, max 64 chars). Source: ``"header"``.
   The customer's auth-proxy / sidecar is the canonical place to pin
   tenancy — it knows the tenant best.

2. **Hash** — when no header is present but both an auth_mode (from
   F1) and a bearer token are. The key is
   ``sha256("{auth_mode}:{api_key_prefix}")[:24]`` where
   ``api_key_prefix`` is the first 8 chars of the bearer token. Source:
   ``"hash"``. SHA-256[:24] is the same idiom PR #395 uses in
   ``headroom/cache/compression_store.py`` for content hashing — keeping
   it consistent so operators only need to learn one truncation rule.
   8 chars of bearer prefix is enough to disambiguate distinct API
   keys without leaking the secret (a 64-char API key has 56 chars of
   unobserved entropy after the prefix).

3. **Global** — the literal ``"global"`` namespace, used only when
   neither a tenant-id header nor an auth bearer is present (the OSS
   single-process / dev / unauthenticated case). Source: ``"global"``.
   This is a real namespace, not a sentinel — the existing pool of
   pre-F3 patterns already lives under ``"global"`` after the
   migration, so a fresh deploy is non-breaking.

Every resolution emits a structured ``tenant_key_resolved`` log event
(NOT silent — see ``feedback_no_silent_fallbacks.md``). Operators can
alert on a sustained ``source="global"`` rate in production to catch
mis-configured upstream auth.

# Sanitization rules

Tenant keys end up in the TOIN serialized store under a separator
(``"|"``) that is illegal by construction in the value, so the
sanitization is conservative on purpose:

- Allowed: ASCII alphanumeric, ``-`` (hyphen), ``_`` (underscore).
- Length cap: 64 chars (prevents log-spam / OOM via giant headers).
- Empty after sanitization: rejected (falls through to the next rule).
- Unicode / control chars: stripped — we use ``unicodedata.category()``
  rather than a regex (per project memory ``no regexes``) so the
  classification is the OS Unicode tables, not a developer-authored
  pattern.

# Configuration

Single env var: ``HEADROOM_TENANT_KEY_HEADER``. Default
``X-Headroom-Tenant-ID``. The header NAME is configurable; the
sanitization rules and the ``"global"`` literal are not — they're
load-bearing for namespace isolation.

# Integration

The handlers call ``resolve_tenant_key(request)`` once at request entry
(right after ``classify_auth_mode``) and store the result on
``request.state.tenant_key`` + ``request.state.tenant_key_source``.
They also call ``set_request_tenant_key(tenant_key)`` to populate the
:class:`contextvars.ContextVar` that TOIN's deep-stack
``record_compression`` / ``record_retrieval`` calls read — same pattern
as the existing ``_request_ccr_store`` ContextVar in
``headroom/cache/compression_store.py``.
